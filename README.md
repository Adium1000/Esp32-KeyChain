# Esp32-KeyChain
Smart Esp32 KeyChain with 5x5 RGB Led Matrix

# Beta 0.1
The project is not ready yet, we have only finished the schematics.

Main idea:
A smart keychain capable of displaying emotions on a 5x5 grid and turning on automatically thanks to the GY 521 sensor. We have also integrated a touch button for automatic Bluetooth activation, and in the future we will add a mini speaker to the next design.
